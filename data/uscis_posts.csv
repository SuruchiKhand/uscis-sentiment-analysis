1mpki0x,Officially a U.S Citizen ü•≥üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Took my oath today ‚Äî all by myself!,"I had my oath ceremony this morning at the Brooklyn Field Office, and it turned out to be a completely unique experience.

My appointment was at 10:00 AM, so I showed up at Federal Plaza around 9:30. I was surprised right away ,no lines at security, not a single person in sight. When I got upstairs to the 8th floor, it was completely empty. The check-in windows were closed, and even the security guard looked confused. He asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù and then told me the office was actually closed to the public today for a training day.

That‚Äôs when I started thinking maybe there was some mistake. The guard took my paper to double-check with USCIS officials, and they came back saying, ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre expecting him.‚Äù Turns out‚Ä¶ they had planned the oath just for me.

I was the only applicant in the entire building. The officers were incredibly nice and welcoming. They had actually called me on Monday offering a Friday oath date, but since I mentioned I was traveling soon, they moved it to Wednesday after talking with a supervisor. I just never imagined it would be a completely solo ceremony!

It took only about 10 minutes start to finish, and now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm officially a U.S. citizen! Feeling so proud and grateful. üá∫üá∏

If you're wondering why its so fast and only took 63 days and why they were calling to schedule me an oath very fast they said because my application is military based so it gets expedited and priority processing ",531,70,2025-08-13 23:39:16+00:00,Big-Rabbit2050,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpki0x,new

1mpjgcb,Interview done!! I130 approved on the spot | Baltimore FO,"We had our interview at Baltimore FO last August 11, 2025. We waited in the waiting area for around 15 minutes before our number got called. The interview lasted for 25 minutes. Yes pretty fast lol. During the interview, the officer didnt ask us anything about our relationship. He was just reading our papers and confirming if our name and DOB are right. Then he checked all the additional evidences that i uploaded days before our interview. Then he said ‚ÄúI see everything here and it seems real to me. Im gonna approve your i130‚Äù then he proceeded handing me a copy of the security questions for i485 and double checked everything before I sign it. After that, he gave us a piece of paper and said he‚Äôs gonna ask his supervisor to review our i485 again before we get an approval. He also assured us its not gonna take too long and he doesnt think they need anything from us.

Is there a chance my i485 will be denied? or checking with supervisor is just part of their processes?

1mphiyi,Clarification on I-130 and I-485 Information & Correction Process,"Hello,

I previously submitted Form I-130 for my wife. Since then, I have naturalized and am now submitting Forms I-485 and I-864.

After reviewing the I-130, I realized there may have been some errors. I am seeking guidance on the following points and how best to resolve them:

---

I-130 Concerns

1. Beneficiary entry information ‚Äì In the section asking for class of admission, we mistakenly entered H1B instead of B2.

2. I-94 expiry date ‚Äì We entered an incorrect date, which we noticed when encountering a similar question on the I-485.

3. Employment status ‚Äì We indicated ‚Äúunemployed outside the U.S.‚Äù when this was not accurate.

---

I-485 Questions

4. Port of entry ‚Äì Is it correct to list ‚Äúadmitted as visitor‚Äù in the question asking for port of entry?

5. Household size ‚Äì Should this be based on the address listed on my wife‚Äôs income tax forms or on her current physical address? (We file taxes separately.)

---

I-864 Questions

6. Household size - Do I need to show wife's employment/income details if mine is above the threshold gor poverty guidelines?

---

If correcting these requires submitting a separate letter to USCIS, we are prepared to do so.

1mphgnp,"Same sex marriage; I-765, I-130 and I-485 APPROVED, within 3 months.","I know that this process can be stressful, but I wanted to share how my I-765, I-130 and I-485 application with USCIS, went so far. There is light at the end of the tunnel if you are truthful and organized with your process. ;)

I am from Mexico and my J-1 visa was about to expire on May 15th, so my husband and I took the decision to marry on May 3rd. It's a very important moment in life so remember to do it just with and for LOVE.

Then, at the end of May with the support of our incredible Lawyer, we submitted form ""I-765, I-130 and I-485"". We did it at the USCIS office in Phoenix, Arizona since my lawyer is from that state.

On June 6th, my lawyer, my husband and I received a notification via email, letting us know that USCIS in Phoenix received our applications.

On June 13th, one day before my grace period for my J-1 expired, USCIS updated information through their online portal and let us know that my Biometrics appointment was scheduled for July 3rd.

5 days after attending my biometrics, on July 8th, USCIS booked my interview for my I-130 and I-485; at first I thought that they had waived it since in the USCIS portal, it was check marked as COMPLETED, but I recommend you to double check it since the web page, sometimes, is not accurate.

One day after booking my interview, USCIS approved my I-765 Employment authorization form, and on July 15th my employment card was produced and shipped. This basically took a month and few days to be approved.

What I recommend you to do while you wait for your interview to happen, is to continue gathering as many evidence you can for your ""Bona Fides of Relationship and proof of residence"", so you can make your case STRONGER. Also what I advise is to upload it to the USCIS portal. It will be very helpful that you submit as many electronically evidence as you can. BEING ORGANIZED IS A PLUS!

Then finally, the day of our interview arrived; August 12th at the USCIS' offices  in Albuquerque, NM. Of course my husband and I were very nervous, but if you prepare, you will see that the interview will be very smooth.

Fortunately, the USCIS officer that interviewed us was very professional and kind. Our interview was more like a conversation about our adventures and relationship. It last just 30 min, aprox.

Within 5 minutes of the interview, the officer approved my husband's I-130 Petition for Alien relative form. And at the end of the interview, he also approved my I-485 Permanent residence or Adjustment of status form. My husband and I celebrated our relieve and we wished Best of luck to all the couples that were at the waiting room, waiting for their interview as well.

About the USCIS portal. Don't get stress if you don't see updates in your case status. It took one day to be updated and show that the I-130 and I-485 were verbally approved by the officer. I believe it depends on each case. :)

SO... TODAY MY I-485 WAS APPROVED, AND I WANTED TO SHARE MY HAPPINESS!!

I wish you all the beautiful energy to your process and I hope that everything runs smoothly for you! ;)

1mpgnxh,Marriage-Based I-130 Pending for 17 Months inside US ‚Äì What to Expect Next?,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to ask if anyone else has been in a similar situation and could help me understand what to expect next.

I have a marriage-based Form I-130 pending for 17 months while I‚Äôm in the United States. For a long time, I didn‚Äôt have any updates in my account. Then, on July 18, I received a notification through the Lawfully app that there was an update on my case. However, when I checked the app and the official USCIS website, I couldn‚Äôt see any actual change or new information.

After about two weeks, I contacted USCIS through their online agent. They told me they couldn‚Äôt see what the update was‚Äîit might be an internal update that isn‚Äôt shown publicly. I also found out that my case was transferred to the local USCIS field office in my city around May 19.

I‚Äôm not really sure what this means or what I should expect next. Has anyone gone through something similar? Any insights on next steps or timelines would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

1mpehq5,[UPDATE] Denied Entry into US as Conditional Permanent Resident,"Hi all...an update on our issue...

CBP incorrectly listed his case as denied in their system. His I-751 petition is still pending. This was all due to clerical error and is now fixed. We're going back to the US. Insane stuff. Thanks to all those who reached out!

Original Post...

My partner, an Irish immigrant and provisional green card holder/conditional permanent resident traveling with an I-797 (48 month extension valid through September 2026), and a pending I-751, was denied re-entry into the US last week. CBP system states his green card is denied, while USCIS has confirmed multiple times that his I-751 is still pending.

For context, he married in 2018 and received his green card in 2020. They were divorced in late 2024 (his application updated with the necessary divorce decree). His I-751 petition still remains pending with USCIS, and has been since submission in 2022. He has traveled internationally during this period with no problems.

The US embassy also denied him for a boarding foil, stating the same thing as CBP, green card denied.

Has anyone experienced anything like this before?",94,16,2025-08-13 19:44:38+00:00,Vegetable_Dust_19,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mpehq5/update_denied_entry_into_us_as_conditional/,hot

1mpfeqs,BEWARE Boundless Immigration. They incorrectly stated in my addendum that I overstayed my visa.,"**Short version:**

I entered legally on an F1 visa. Boundless Immigration slowed down my application significantly, especially as we over-relied on them and trusted them too much to keep us updated on changing USCIS policies. I filed for adjustment of status based on my marriage to a US citizen, during my 60-day grace period. Boundless Immigration erronously stated I overstayed my visa. When they corrected their mistake on the i-485 form, they did not correct their mistake on the addendum. In our urgency and panic to submit everything on time, we did not catch their mistake until we saw the scanned copies that USCIS received. Now we might have to hire a lawyer to get their mistake fixed.

**Long version:**

Originally arrived to the US in 2017 on an **F1 visa**, where I met my now-husband (**USC**). We became very close friends in 2019 on a study abroad program together, and started dating in 2021 after he came to visit me in my country (a Muslim-majority country in MENA). In 2022, I applied for a **B1/B2 to visit** the US, meet his family, and catch up with old friends. I did **not** overstay my visa. I visited the US again in 2023 on my B1/B2 visa for a friend's wedding, and again, did **not** overstay my visa and did **not** accumulate 6 months over a period of 365 days.

I applied and was accepted for a few different MA programs across different countries. My husband is a dual EU-American citizen, and I originally was leaning toward going to school in the EU and having him move there with me. However, a U.S. college offered me a full ride, and so we decided to move there together instead. I re-entered the U.S. in **2023** on an **F-1 visa**. My husband proposed to me in October 2024. In November 2024, after we decided we wanted to live in his U.S. hometown close to his family, we decided to use the services of **Boundless Immigration**. Even though we had a straightforward case, we figured that the attorney package ($1249) was a good value for money and that it was more prudent to have a professional check our application.

**We now regret using Boundless badly.** I wish we had done more research on the process itself to realize how simple it is, and that we could have done it ourselves faster and cheaper without their terrible service. I feel we would have been more on ""top of it"" instead of trusting their service. They don't show you the full steps you need to take upfront, and when USCIS policy changed to require a medical exam to be submitted at the same time as i-485, Boundless didn't notify us and we didn't realize that the policy had changed.

The following months were brutal on us as a couple: we dealt with serious family health issues, personal tragedy, my husband's serious injury, our car breaking down, while juggling my MA thesis, a full credit load + 20 hours of work, and my husband's demanding job. My husband is also trans and so we were dealing with the bureacracy of name change as we wanted all the documents to consistently have the correct name and sex before filing.

Working on the immigration forms fell to the back burner, and **we were defaulting to Boundless' expertise and were not as proactive as we would have been if we were filing on our own.** This part *is* on us, but is frankly another reason I recommend people with simple cases not to repeat my mistakes - even if it was psychological.

We waited until we finished gathering all the documents/information for the first form in their process to schedule an appointment with their lawyers, which was then 3 weeks out. By the time we spoke to the lawyer, she said it was too late for me to file OPT as it would be fraud since I had immigrant intent.

In **March 2025**, we had a small and private courthouse wedding.

After submitting my thesis in **May 2025,** my #1 priority was to file my i-485 and i-30 before the end program date on my I-20. We were shocked at how slow Boundless' service was. They returned our forms to us several times, and each time we had to wait 5 business days for them to tell us we had to change another small detail. **Boundless claimed that it did not matter whether or not I overstayed past my grace period, as it would be ""forgiven anyway"", and to ""rest assured"" it would not complicate my application.**

We then moved in May, had to deal with the moving out process, then had to re-do all our addresses and update on their form again and update drivers licenses etc. We found out we needed to submit the medical exam and all vaccine records at the same time as i-485, which delayed us further as I had to wait for an appointment with a civil surgeon (I had to travel 2 hours to get to a clinic that had an appointment that wasn't months out!) and get new vaccinations. I sent Boundless my sealed medical exam records, and after that, we felt held hostage by them.

At this point, the program end date on my I-20 was looming, and we were just rushing to send in the forms before my 60-day grace period. After everything on Boundless' end was finally done and they shared the application for us to review, **we found several small mistakes and one egregious mistake - they claimed I violated US immigration law by overstaying my visa.** This was during my 60-day grace period. We asked a family friend who is an immigration attorney, and he said I had **not** **overstayed** as it was legal to adjust your status during the grace period. He also said that I needed to submit my application *immediately* before the 60-day grace period ended; if USCIS did not *receive* my application before my grace period expired, I would have overstayed, and it would make my case harder than it had to be under the new administration.

This led to us panicking and rushing. Boundless initially refused to correct their mistake, then relented upon our insistence. Their customer service team was apologetic in their AI-written emails and prioritized our case for faster turn-around and same day shipping. **USCIS received my application before my grace period ended.** All's well that ends well, right? I fucking wish. When we checked their scanned docs of what we sent them, we found out that while Boundless removed that I had violated US immigration law on my i-485 itself, **they still said ""Visa Overstay"" on the addendum.**

Now I have no idea if that's going to complicate my case or not, or if we will now need to hire a lawyer. Instead of Boundless being a 1200$ish mistake, it might cost us several thousand $$ to fix their mistake.

We've spent hundreds of hours on the immigration process, and we're crushed. I'm now scared of an NTA being issued, or getting a Stokes interview, or even being held in ICE custody. I know that even *if* worst comes to worst, my situation is a lot simpler and more privileged than others - I've technically overstayed 0 days, and we would most likely adjust status in front of the judge in the worst case scenario.

**But Boundless still has caused us so much unnecessary strife and anxiety.** Our case is *so* simple - we were worried about facing discrimination as a queer couple and as someone from a Muslim-majority country, which is why we even decided to get a Boundless lawyer to review our application. But we have so much evidence of a bona fide marriage (a shared lease, renters' insurance, health insurance, life insurance, years of photos, 2 affidavits each signed by our mothers and best friends respectively, cards mailed & addressed to us congratulating us on our engagement by friends, a shared car registration, and credit cards with each other as authorized users). Since filing, we now have new evidence (wills with each other as beneficiaries, living wills with each other as designated health agents, updated matching addresses on our driver's licenses, and me as a beneficiary to his 401-k). My husband can afford to sponsor me without a co-sponsor. 

# Lessons learned:

# 1. DO NOT USE BOUNDLESS IMMIGRATION.

**2. Do everything sooner than you have to.** Gather your documents early - even before the wedding! Ask people for their affidavits early, they will take longer than they say they will. Book your medical exam appointment months out and take vaccines ASAP if you need to.

**3. Don't rush** even if up against a deadline. Take your time triple-checking everything.

**4. Never trust your lawyer or immigration service so much that you fail to do your own due diligence and research.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Any advice or words of encouragement you guys would have for me is very welcome!** Advice on whether I should hire an immigration lawyer is especially useful even though it is something that would cause us financial strain as I'm not working right now.  Feel free to tell me that I'm freaking out over nothing too if that's how you feel :')",24,27,2025-08-13 20:18:48+00:00,Fickle_Doubt_9322,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mpfeqs/beware_boundless_immigration_they_incorrectly/,hot

1mpbix2,Boston I-485 Interview,"This morning, I woke up feeling like my stomach had been replaced by a bag of rocks. We filed the I-485 for my wife back in April 2025, she did her fingerprints in May, and today was the big day ‚Äî our USCIS interview.

Walking into the Boston field office felt surreal. My mind kept replaying every ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario. What if they think we‚Äôre not genuine? What if I forget something?

The officer called us in, and to my surprise, she was warm and approachable. She took me in first. For 30 minutes, we talked. We laughed. She asked about my job (I‚Äôm in law enforcement), and we found common ground there. It didn‚Äôt feel like an interrogation it felt like a conversation with someone who actually cared about understanding our story .

She told me everything looked fine, but she wished we had more photos with family .Fair point I‚Äôve never been the ‚Äútake a million selfies‚Äù type.

Then she interviewed my wife. Our answers matched perfectly because, well, they‚Äôre true. She told my wife the same thing she told me: she believes our relationship is genuine.

No on-the-spot approval. No magic words. Just, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll receive a notice.‚Äù But I walked out feeling a wave of relief. We had told our truth, and she believed us.

1mp7p5s,"DACA TO AOS MARRIED TO USC, NYC FIELD INTERVIEW DIDNT GO SO GREAT.","LONG POST, trying to be as detailed as possible, so I can have some type of advice? or hopeful words, prayers, anything at this point. 



We had our interview yesterdat at the NYC field¬†office, and it didn't go as good. BTW. My husband has (DACA) and I am the USC spouse. 

**Timeline:**

DACA since 2016

1st AP: 2/2024

HAD A BABY: 10/2024

Married: 12/2024

I-130(SUBMITTED ONLINE): 1/12/2025

I-485(SUBMITTED BY MAIL): 3/10/2025

Actively Reviewing: 3/13/2025

BIOMETRICS REUSED

**2ND ADVANCE PAROLE(EMERGENCY): 6/18/2025**

**This AP was given to us in person at the NYC field office**

Interview SCHEDULED: 7/3/2025

Interview DATE: 8/12/2025 NYC FIELD OFFICE

When we arrived (we waited 2 hours), the officer tells us our papers were assigned to someone else incorrectly, hence the wait. She asked basic questions, how did we meet, when was our first date? how many kids we have? We explained we each have a child from **previous** relationships (both girls, both 10 years old, so we ALWAYS have to explain that they are not twins, but that we had them prior) we have a 3rd child, mutual, a 10 month old baby (she went with us to the interview).

**THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET UPSETTING**. The officer starts asking my husband how did he enter the US when he was a child. My husband explained that he doesn't¬†know. All he knows is that he had to be **under** 2yrs old, because of all of the records from elementary school,¬†**vaccination records (the yellow booklet shows he got vaccines in NYC in 1995**), proof of childhood in the US, etc.¬†He continued to explain that his mom, passed away in 2017, and she would be the **ONLY** person that can answer how he initially entered as a baby. But she never told him. He explained that his mom was mentally unstable, suffered from severe depression, and eventually passed away from medication intoxication (we provided the death certificate). The officer asked if his mom ever tried to get his papers in order. my husband answered yes, from what he can remember, as a teen, she was going to do the green card process through domestic violence. the officer said, **WORD BY WORD: ""Oh so she was going to lie?""** and my husband respectfully answered: ""No. my mom was abused by my dad, hence the reason for her mental instability and eventually cause of death"". The question offended him, because he felt that the officer was insensitive of his mom.

 The officer then stated that AP isn't a valid lawful entry and cant be used as an entry for AOS. She said he needed an initial inspection when he was a baby and that's the **only** way she would be able to approve him.¬†We tried to rebuttal saying that in immigration laws, AP **does** qualify as a **legal entry**, but she wasn't having it. We also didnt want to be rude or seem as if we know more than her so we just kept going with the interview.The officer also stated that he needs to find out how he entered the US. A part of me felt like she was probing, trying to get him to say that he entered with someone elses papers, which again, he doesn't know, HE WAS A BABY!. Anyway, fast forward to the end of the interview, she said it can take up to 120 days for her to review and make her decision. She said if she denies him, he has to start the process all over, or find another way to get his immigration status. 

We are totally BUMMED! I could tell he was frustrated, on the verge of tears.¬† Now I guess we just wait for answers. My husband and I have been together since 2022. we met in 2021. Our relationship is real, our family is beautiful (she even said it herself, looking at all of the pictures we have). 

She said that the **ONLY** reason she would deny him is due to that inital entrance discrepancy.¬†We gave her **BOTH I-94's from both AP in 2024 and 2025**. The advance parole in 2024 was BEFORE we submitted the AOS. Making it a valid legal entry. This is in the USCIS policy and immigration lawa.

**She saw the stamps in his passports.** So yeah, at this point all I ask is for your prayers <3. Good luck to everyone going through ANY immigration process. None of it is easy.

BTW:¬†THIS ISN'T TO SCARE ANYONE, I HOPE EVERYONE HAS A BETTER EXPERIENCE THAN WE DID! This is just to share our experience and maybe this CAN HELP SOMEONE OUT THERE.

1mpfngg,I-130 APPROVED!,"Hi everyone! 

We submitted our I-130 in November 2024 and had our interview July 31st, 2025. 

Our interview was scheduled for 9:30am in the Orlando office, we got there at like 9am, got our number and sat down until we got called in. We were very nervous since we had read a lot of mixed experiences, but nonetheless we were trying to keep calm and relaxed. 

This is what we brought to the interview: all the paperwork we had already submitted + originals (birth certificate, passports, ID's, etc), a photo album I had put together for the interview, any new evidence we had submitted through the portal (2024 taxes we filed jointly, new photos, plain tickets for me to visit my husband since I was away on an internship for the Summer, new health insurance we have together). 

When they called our number we went in and the lady who took care of us was THE SWEETEST ever. She was very calm and positive throughout the whole process. 

Most of the time she was looking at her screen and when it came to the questions she only asked us:

\- Are you guys doing something after here?

\- How did you meet? we met at work, so she then asked,

\- Do you guys still work together?

\- The I-485 questions to my husband since he is the beneficiary

\- Is there any new evidence you would like to submit?

So we gave her the new evidence, and that was it! No more questions. There was some small talk regarding her office set up which was decorated so nicely. She finalized by saying we should have the USCIS portal updated soon.

The next day it said approved on the USCIS portal and on 8/11/2025 my husband received his green card in the mail! It was SO fast! 

I want to thank everyone here on the Reddit community for all your guidance and information. It truly played a big part in the whole application process for my husband and I. Especially because we did not use a lawyer or paralegal, we filled everything ourselves. 

PM me or ask here any questions regarding the process and GOOD LUCK! you will get yours soon as well! ",12,5,2025-08-13 20:28:04+00:00,RookieCookie98,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mpfngg/i130_approved/,hot

1mp7mq1,Successful Interview Today and Was Told We Will Have Results by End of Day!,"I‚Äôll preface this by saying the whole process was not at all what we expected. (Pleasantly surprised) Our appointment was for 7am, but we didn‚Äôt get seen until 7:45am despite being one of the only two couples there. 

First, the immigration officer calls for my husband only while I waited nervously. I feel we definitely over prepared by far, and they didn‚Äôt even need any of the additional evidence/documents I stayed up all night printing haha. They asked basics like why did he visit the US in the past, our relationship, birthdays, etc. Then they asked the usual polygamy, prostitution , deportation questions etc. (the fun stuff, right)

Then he told us all we needed was an official criminal record report (didn‚Äôt know we needed to provide that), and let us leave to go to the nearest police station to get one. We came right back and the same officer saw we were back and let us cut to give the document. 

I wasn‚Äôt interviewed once, just my Korean husband. Overall was a really smooth process and I‚Äôm really grateful to the New Mexico immigration office for being so helpful and kind throughout today‚Äôs process! 

Fingers crossed we hear back soon, they said it will be in mail but we are checking to USCIS portal constantly as well to wait for the result! ",19,3,2025-08-13 15:31:06+00:00,DoomDaDaDippyDa,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mp7mq1/successful_interview_today_and_was_told_we_will/,hot
1mpe38s,"I-485 & I-130 approved in exactly 6 months, good interview experience :)","This page has been so helpful to me, so I hope my timeline can help someone else :) DACA recipient, married a USC. Since we've been married more than 2 years, my GC is the 10-year version. Salt Lake City Field Office

* Filed: 1/31/25
* Case Received: 2/12/25
* RFE Issued: 3/4/25 ‚Äì They wanted more proof of my husband‚Äôs income because it can be a little confusing due to having multiple sources and types of income
* RFE Response Received: 5/8/25
* Interview Scheduled: 7/3/25
* Interview Date: 8/11/25
* Approved: 8/12/25

For the interview, I hired a lawyer who is familiar with this field office and its officers, which was 100% worth it! We had to make a few form corrections, so having a lawyer there was much less stressful. I was worried about things like my ID still had our old apartment address, there were typos on the form, and that I didn't want to change my last name, but none of that was a big deal at the interview.

The officer was very calm and kind. He asked how we met and how long we've been together, details about our wedding, if we have kids or plan to. My husband and I keep our finances mostly separate just because we feel it's healthy for our relationship, or in some cases like his health insurance it saves money, so he asked us about those things and why they were missing.   
  
However, we have a shared savings account with which we pay our shared expenses, bought a home together last year and have been together for more than 10 years (we submitted a 44-page photo packet) and upon seeing these things the officer seemed more confident in our relationship, the rest of the questions felt a little more casual. Additional evidence included a shared loan for plumbing work, home insurance, a past lease together, my husband being an insured driver on my car, my husband being on my vision insurance, past trip itineraries and plane tickets, letters of support from friends and family. He did look at all of the evidence. The computer was running slowly, so he‚Äôd think of random new questions, and even joked around with our lawyer a bit. He asked about our dog's breed (he was in a lot of our photos), whether we know each other's parents, asked about our jobs. Confirmed our information like full names and addresses. He did the I-485 yes/no questions as well. At the end, he said he was recommending approval. The USCIS platform updated to approved the next day. This is my home, and my husband is my everything, so I'm very happy :) Wishing all the best for all of you!",8,3,2025-08-13 19:29:36+00:00,tzir0,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mpe38s/i485_i130_approved_in_exactly_6_months_good/,hot
1mpda1i,Anyone with same issues after interview.,"Here is my timeline. I‚Äôm on F-1 status; married to USC. Filed 7mo after marriage. I got a DUi charge January and the court had it finalized Aug 1 just few days before my interview. We had our first child after 10mo of marriage. No, work permit yet but I worked without one. 
During the interview, we submitted our child birth certificate as more evidence. That was only what the interviewer asked for concerning more evidence. Questions were few concerning the marriage since we have a baby. Few questions like DOB, address of where we live, asked about both parents. Asked for my current i-20 which I presented cause I‚Äôm still enrolled in school. 
Lastly she asked about the DUI case if resolved. Our lawyer forwarded copies of the court disposition. She scanned in and she said she was going to look into that later. The interview ended and she said she cannot make final decision now and hand over a white paper as evidence we‚Äôd attended the interview. Please how long can the case be reviewed? 

Another concern, my school is resuming soon but I can‚Äôt resume with them cause I will be baby sitting our child while my wife works. I‚Äôm out of work till I get either of my work permit or GC. How safe is it opting out school for this semester. I‚Äôve a nursing program for next year spring but I can‚Äôt attend for fall semester.

1mpdhlz,GC Interview AOS Boston Office,"EDIT- Approval notices in account for both I-485 and I-130, 24 hours after interview!  
Just finished our interview!

For context I was on F-1 when we applied, no overstays, no criminal background, only thing I had was accidental violation of my visa 3 years ago and I fixed it (unauthorized work for 2 days). No lawyer, no preparer. Both 22 years old, submitted 2 weeks after getting married.

5/2/2025- PD , 5/29 - biometrics , 6/7 combo card approved, 7/7 interview notice, 8/13 interview

Our interview time was 9:35am but we got to the office at 9am. I will say we got to the area at 8:45am and finding parking/getting to the office took us 15 minutes, a bit of a walk in the building to the interview area just an fyi. We waited till 10:30 to be called and my husband was called in first (petitioner). At around 10:45 I was called in and my husband was able to stay in the room sitting behind me.

I had given him the folder so I'm not sure exactly what they asked to see from the folder but the new evidence and his birth certificate was on the table when I walked in. I had a folder with: all of the notices we received through mail, EAD combo card, OPT card, copies of previous passports, current passport, copies of old visa, current visa, all my I-20s, I-94, new I-130 evidence (which I had uploaded to the system prior the interview), old I-130 evidence, new job paystubs for I-485 (again, uploaded prior), original birth certificates of both of us and copies, original marriage certificate and copy, receipts of all the payments.

This is just my experience so maybe your officer will be different but I chose to not re-print our whole application cause it was 300 pages and I'm glad I didn't. It looked like he only cared for identification, new evidence and birth certificate of the petitioner.

When I sat down after taking an oath, he asked if we had more evidence and I said every new evidence was uploaded about a week ago. He said if they are in the system he doesn't need to see them. Here are the questions I got asked:

\- When, where and how did we meet?

\- When did we become a couple?

\- When did we start talking about marriage?

\- Have we met each other's parents and how are our relationships with them?

\- What are our future plans together?

\- Do we want any kids?

And honestly that was pretty much it. We had went through our camera roll last night to refresh our memories of all the birthdays and anniversaries we had together but he didn't even ask lol. My husband said the only different answer we had  was ""our future together"". He apparently talked about career goals and where we want to move next, I said we want a dog lmao. The officer thought it was funny and he actually said ""I thought you were a cat person"" cause we have two cats lol.

Overall the officer made it feel like a conversation and told us how marriage is hard work and how he met his wife in college too etc. which we really appreciated. At the end I asked if we can be approved and he said he can't do that because there is supposed to be like a background check or something but he isn't worried about our case at all. He said we should hear back soon or even get the card. He told us about the conditional green card and how to get the conditions removed. He added ""you only need to put up with him for 2 years"" which was hilarious.

I tried to cover most of it but feel free to comment any questions, I'd be happy to help!",5,1,2025-08-13 19:06:38+00:00,AcanthisittaReady247,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mpdhlz/gc_interview_aos_boston_office/,hot

I attended my removal of conditions on green card interview with my spouse on the 6th of May. Weeks went by without a decision so I contacted my congressman office to make an inquiry with USCIS on the case.

This is the feedback that was given. Does anyone know what this actually means?

""...regarding her I-751 Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence...As a part of a greater eligibility determination, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducts background and security checks on applicants and certain petitioners for immigration benefits.¬†These checks are necessary to ensure United States national security and public safety interests.¬†In some cases, the results of these checks require USCIS to perform additional inquiries or consult with other government agencies.¬†When this is necessary, there is often some delay in resolving the checks, and it is difficult to predict when resolution will be completed.¬†Please be assured that this case has not been overlooked.¬†Once all checks are resolved, the application will be adjudicated, and your constituent will be notified of the decision...""",3,10,2025-08-13 20:51:49+00:00,LauraRose20,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mpgaag/uscis_feedback_to_congressman_for_i751_removal_of/,hot
